Hi, Iâ€™m Nathanael, an Iban Sea Dayak from Kuching. I am studying Software Engineering at University of Malaysia Sarawak and have a Diploma in Information Technology. I have experience managing websites, databases and using tools like Python, Django and MySQL.

I enjoy music and play the violin, guitar and bass. I also like managing sound systems as an audio technician. Outside of work and studies, I am adventurous and enjoy meeting new people and learning about different perspectives. I used to play competitive e-sports and worked as both a leader and a team player. I am also active in badminton, a sport I love.

With technical skills, adaptability and a passion for teamwork, I strive to contribute meaningfully to technology-driven projects while embracing new challenges in diverse environments.
